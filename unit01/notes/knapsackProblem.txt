--Optimization Problems 1:1--
[What is an Optimization Model?]
• An objective function that is to be maximized or minimized
  ° Minimize time spent traveling from New York to Boston
• A set of constraints (possible empty) that must be honored
  ° Cannot spend more than $100
  ° Must be in Boston before 5:00PM

[Takeaways]
• Many problems of real importance can be formulated as an optimization problem
• Reducing a seemingly new problem to an instance of a well-known problem allows one to use pre-existing methods for solving them
• Solving optimization problems is computationally challenging
• A greedy algorithm is often a practical approach to finding a pretty good approximate solution to an optimization problem

[The Knapsack Problem]
- Description:
  • You have limited strength, so there is a maximum weight that can be carried
  • You would LIKE to take more stuff than you can carry
  • How do you choose which stuff to take and which to leave behind?
- Variants:
  • 0/1 problem: discrete units with value
  • Continuous/fractional: units can be split with proportional value

- 0/1 Problem Formalized:
  • Each item is represented by a pair, <value, weight>
  • The knapsack can accommodate items with a total weight of no more that w
  • A vector, L, of length n, represents the set of available items. Each element of the vector is an items
  • A vector, V, of length n, is used to indicate whether or not items are take.
    ° If V[i] = 1, item I[i] is taken
    ° If V[i] = 0. item I[i] is not taken
  • Find a V that maximizes V[i]*I[i].value subject to constraint that V[i]*I[i].weight <= w

[Methods of Solving Optimization Problems]
- Brute Force Algorithm:
  1. Enumerate all possible combinations of items, i.e. generate all subsets of the set of subject. Also known as the "power set".
  2. Remove all of the combinations whose total units exceeds the allowed weight.
  3. From the remaining combinations choose any one whose value is the largest.

- Issues with Brute Force:
  • Not practically scalable. Big O on this method is 2^n, exponential.
